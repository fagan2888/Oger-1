These are some small hacks for MDP with reservoirs.

in the folder "Experimentfase 1" are some basic experiments with MDP and reeservoirs.

The folder "grhlib" contains additional nodes for MDP (reservoir_nodes, resample_nodes, svm_nodes), and look also in the "test" folder therein for some use cases.

All other folder are some experiments with really bad code.


Look at it at your own risk !
